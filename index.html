                    <h5> An introduction </h5>
		<p>
                    Cyber Security is important for everyone - however teaching such an in-depth and ever changing subject to children and young adults 
		    can be challenging. The aim of this website is to supplement this process by giving up-to-date information on a wide variety
                    of issues relating to Cyber Security and the prevention of security breaches and in turn, malicious attacks.
                    <br> These demographics are amongst the heaviest users of the internet; but also generally have a lower level of understanding of 
		    security risks and common malicious practices. This means that younger people on the internet are massively
                    at risk, and it is important to educate them on how to avoid and prevent instances of security breaches.
                </p>

                <h5>Security Mechanisms</h5>
                <a id="security"></a>

                <p> The risk of cyber-attacks is at an all-time high, with major attacks taking place every day (<a href="https://cyware.com/cyber-security-news-articles">
		    CyWare </a> is a good news page dedicated to recording cyber-attacks). However, security mechanisms to combat cyber threats are 
		    commonplace in the working world today. It is paramount for any business or organisation to understand how to protect itself. 
		    Many different security mechanisms can be utilised, and we will be highlighting and explaining a few of the most common ones on 
		    this page.

                            <h4>Access Control</h4>
                            <img src="authentication.jpg" alt=" Picture of fingerprint " />
				
				<h5>Authentication</h5>

                            <p>
                                The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) describes authentication as the process of determining if someone is who they 
				claim to be. For a real-world example, this is akin to checking identification or a signature. A key security measure, 
				authentication can stop intruders accessing important information under false pretences.
                            </p>
				<h5> Authorisation </h5>
				
				<p> Authorisation is a similar security measure to authentication, with the difference being this can be used to access levels of privilege 
				    for clients or users. For example, administrative staff in a company may be able to write and read data, but clients would not have the 
				    authorisation to write data - only to read it. Again, this helps to stop intruders as well protects the data. </p>

                                <img src="password.jpg" alt="iPhone password " />

                                <p>Perhaps the most well known security mechanisms, nearly everyone has to use passwords in their day to day lives. 
				   While it is just a method of authentication, a password uses encryption to hide a specific phrase. </p>

                                        A more technical security measure than the aforementioned ones. The Cambridge Dictionary defines this as 
					‘The process of changing electronic information or signals into a secret code that people cannot understand or 
					use without special equipment. A key mechanism for safely transferring data, encryption is widely used in 
					messaging apps, for example, Signal or WhatsApp.

                                        <p>
                                            The NCSC describes a firewall as a hardware or software which uses a rule set to control network traffic to prevent unauthorised access 
					    to or from a network. Essentially, a firewall acts as a barrier protecting a network from anything suspicious entering.

                                            An Intrusion Detection System, or more commonly an IDS, is a monitoring device that detects threats and generates alerts. While is this 
					    like a firewall, rather than just permitting or blocking network connections, an IDS will signal an alarm. This would then go to notify 
					   someone to investigate and respond to an incident.

              <h5>  Issues around privacy in business information systems. </h5>
	
                <p>   
                Cyber-crime is an umbrella term used to refer to the use of computers or information technology being used to 
                commit unlawful acts with the intention to disrupt, steal or ransom. Cyber-dependant crimes are crimes that can 
                only be committed through the utilisation of computing technologies that target other computing systems, 
                whereas Cyber-enabled crimes are instances where ‘traditional’ crimes have gained a wider reach or increased 
                scale due to computers making them more effective and far easier to carry out. (Reference 2)
                </p>
			
		<br>
			
                <p>
                Cyber-crimes can be varying affairs, from some users simply being annoyed by the inconvenience, to 
                business’ experiencing enormous financial loss and, in the most extreme cases even loss of life. 
                Over recent years, the frequency of cyber-attacks has been increasing steadily, with 2021 being a record year 
                for the number of cyber-attacks reported (Reference 3), and with no signs of slowing down, cyber security is 
                one of – if not the most integral part of business infrastructure. The increase in users of high-powered mobile 
                devices has contributed to the growth of cyber security risk - both because of everyday people being more 
                susceptible to malicious behaviour and hackers being able to reproduce attacks previously limited to needing a computer to do so. 
                </p>
			
		<br>
		
                <p>
                There are a myriad of possible attacks targeting secure data in business, some of the most common are: 
                </p>
			
		<br>
                
                <h5> Brute force attacks </h5> 
			
		<p>	
		Brute force attacks make up about 5% of recorded cyber-attacks and are performed by utilising a program that is 
                effectively ‘guessing’ the username and password needed to access a system as many times as it takes to guess correctly. 
                Brute force attacks come in many forms – one type is called a ‘dictionary attack’ and guesses based on possible known phrases. 
                Brute force attacks are simple but have a high success rate. To combat brute force attacks, usernames and passwords 
                should be long and complex and not utilise information that is personal to the user or company. (Reference 4)
                </p>
			
		<br>
                
		<h5> Malware </h5> 
		    
		<p>
		If left unfound, malware can be catastrophic to the integrity of a business’s intellectual property and public image. 
                Malware comes in many different forms with some of the more popular being Ransomware – used to encrypt business data and 
                charge money to return it (see WannaCry), and Cryptocurrency ‘mining’ software – which steals computing power in order to 
                mine virtual currency. However the most common by far is a computer virus, used to delete, alter and encrypt business’ 
                files and data, a virus spreads by infecting files and then making copies of itself on systems in order to spread itself 
                across a network with the ultimate intention to disrupt and disable. They can be first encountered on a business system 
                by employees using compromised flash storage or opening emails that have originated from outside of the secure network infrastructure. 
                To prevent the acquisition and spread of malicious files, all software used should be kept up to date such as your 
                operating systems, browsers and anti-virus. Business should also control what USB devices can be connected to computers and 
                firewalls should always be switched on. (Reference 5)
                </p>
			
		<br>
			
                <h5> DDoS attacks </h5>  
			
		<p>	
		DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service attacks are attacks that primarily affect business as it’s a technique used to overload 
                servers and bring down services and websites, if a DDoS attack has been successful, access to a business website will be 
                impossible for users until the issue is resolved. For an attack to be carried out - botnets – a network of infected computers 
                unbeknownst to the users, or programs are used to flood servers with massive traffic so they are unable to cope and will 
                crash under the load, bringing down the website. These attacks are effective and are often used to mask another concurrent 
                and more serious attack. To mitigate DDoS attacks the main method is to have a large enough bandwidth and server capacity 
                so an attack is absorbed and cannot provide enough requests to bring down your website, but you can also employ a WAF or 
                Web Application Firewall that guards you against commonly found web exploits. (Reference 6)
                </p>
			
		<br>
			
                <p>
                Cyber attacks come in multiple forms but these three are some of the more commonly found for businesses and should always be 
                a consideration for every business development as the impact of any attack can be incredibly costly to rectify, not just on 
                a financial level but on a reputational one as well. Companies worldwide suffer data breaches regularly, 
                with Ancestry.com, Apple, T-Mobile and Twitch suffering breaches during 2021 along with over 50 other companies and government 
                institutions, proving clearly why cyber security is such an important aspect of business planning and development. (Reference 7). 
                </p>
			
		<br>
			
                    <h5> Mitigation
                        <a id="mitigations"></a>
                    </h5>
		<p>
                    An effective and near worry-free method of mitigation is the act of Security as a service. Security as a service (SECaas) is the 
		    term used when an outside provider deals with the security for an organisation's computing infrastructure. This generally involves
                    the security company monitoring the system and responding to or preventing any threats that are likely to occur as well as strategies 
		    for things like data loss prevention. Utilizing a SECaas provider can save an organisation time and resources
                    that could be better spent elsewhere in the business. It also negates the need to pay for staff to be routinely trained. 
		    An example of one of the top SECaas companies is McAfee which has been around for a long time and is one of the most trusted names 
		    in the industry.

                <br>

                
                    <h5> Prevention</h5>
		<p>
                    Effective techniques for prevention include: developing effective security policies to make sure everyone knows the rules to adhere 
		    to, making sure that all staff or appropriate users are given relevant security awareness training which will instil the
                    policies and proceedures of the organization into the minds of the staff and ensure that they are followed and implemented at all 
		    times. It is very important if an organization is responsible for its own security that it has reliable
                    security software installed and monitored. The most effective security software will be simple to use and include a straight 
		    forward user interface that is not confusing and is easy to get to grips with. It will allow the organization
                    to monitor and deploy various security functions to the users and systems within the organizations infrastructure. 
		    It should also be intuitive enough that staff using it can accomplish there objectives efficiently and don't have to
                    spend too much time that could be used elsewhere, figuring out how to work the software.
                </p>

               
                    <h5> Detection</h5>

		<p>
		    
                    An Anti-virus that includes all the necessary protections for the specific needs of the organization, such as anti-spyware and 
	            malware, is one of the most important tools to detect any potential threats that an organization can encounter. Restricting
                    access to relevant users only by implementing passwords and log in systems for individuals with varying degrees of permission to 
	            interact with data. Using an access control matrix to assess the eligibility of users is a very effective
                    method of monitoring who can have access to certain data and information, making it easier to deduce who could have sabotaged 
	            or misused their possition, whether intentionally or not. If it was an accidental event then perhaps more
                    training can be provided and if it was a deliberate act then diciplinary action will be easier to take.

                </p>

                
                    <h5> Remediation </h5>

		<p>
		    
                    The act of reacting to the breach once found and limiting the amount of damage that it can do to the organization. The cause then 
	            needs to be identified and prevented next time. A proper plan should be in place that deals with the most serious threats
                    and specifies appropriate countermeasures. Some important elements of remediation are: creating an up to date risk assessment, 
	            employing a suitable monitoring process to keep an eye on comings and goings of data, making sure that staff
                    have relevant training and practice to keep themselves from panicking if malicious events occur, consider security as a service to 
	            outsource the protection and free up employees time to focus on other things, potentially increasing productivity output.

                </p>


                    <h5> More advice</h5>

                <p>
		    
                    There are many issues that can be of concern to a business regarding privacy and it is important to have a good understanding of 
	            what some of the main issues can be as well as ways to mitigate the chances of vulnerabilities, exploits and malicious attacks.
                    If confidential information is kept about individuals by a business, it is essential that the data is kept secure and that access 
	            to the information is moderated appropriately according to the Data Protection Act 2018. At a basic level
                    this can be in the form of passwords and log in details. Permission can also be granted to relevant users based on an Access Control
	            matrix. This is a method of correctly distributing necessary permissions that makes it easier to denote
                    who is granted which level of access to data. There are many reasons that data/info might be attempted to be accessed or collected, 
	            it could be for financial gain if the individual involved wanted to sell information or upload malicious
                    software onto a system. It is very important that the companies regulations for security are followed by all employees as it is 
	            the responsibility of everyone working there once properly trained and instructed to help prevent breaches.

                    <br> This image shows the most commonly used passwords and the amount of times they have been used. It is of the 
			 utmost importance for passwords to be changed routinely, in order to prevent unwanted access
                         to business systems and personal data. The ideal password should have a mix of letters in different cases, numbers and symbols
			 (the NCSC recommends using three random words together) - which would be unlikely to be guessed by a human or by software such as 
			 <a href="https://www.aircrack-ng.org/"> Aircrack-ng </a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Ripper"> John the Ripper. </a>
			 These two hacking tools are easy to find and install and have a lot of relevant information available online so that anyone who wants 
			 to learn to use them for illicit purposes can. This makes passwords the first - and very often the last - line of defence between you 
			 and an attacker.
