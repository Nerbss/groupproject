		<h5>Cyber Security and young people. (SFW) </h5>
		</header>
	
		<p>
			<strong> Your routine </strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			
			Cyber Security is important for everyone, however teaching such an in-depth and ever changing subject to children 
			and young adults can be challenging, the aim of this website is to supplement this process 
			by giving up-to-date information on a wide variety of categories relating to Cyber Security 
			and the prevention of security breaches and malicious attacks.
		<br>
			These demographics are amongst the heaviest users of the internet but also generally have a lower level of 
			understanding of security risks and common malicious practices, this means that younger 
			people on the internet are massively at risk, and it is important to educate them on how 
			to avoid and prevent instances of security breaches.

		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong> Treat your online classes and work as you would do in person </strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			One commonly found way to succeed at online study is to 
			treat the time as you would do in person. This means treating your active
			study time as if you were in a real class, no phones whilst teaching is 
			in prgress, don't chat with other occupants and anything thats would be considered
			taboo in an in-person teaching setting.

			Turning off non work mobile devices and muting social media is also important 
			to maximise attenstion and minimise distractions.

		<br>
			
			Although the idea of studying from home is enticing when you think about attending 
			classes from your bed or playing computer games whilst a lesson is in progress, it is 
			enormously counter productive to your studies and its a all too common mistake made by
			new students.

		<p>
			<strong> Stay Disciplined </strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Another aspect of studying from home is self discipline, meaning 
			you should treat a course as you would if you were attending it 
			in-person. You should alighn your study schedule to that of your course so you 
			are always available for live lectures, rather than their recorded counterparts
			allowing you to ask questions in person should you have them.<br>

			You should also find it useful to have segregated work and rest spaces, ideally
			these being entirely different rooms and not just a desk in a bedroom or living room. 
			This will eliminate the feeling of always being stuck in your workspace and is 
			important for maintaining optimal attention.<br>

			You will also need to set time aside to complete any out of class work you are set
			and undertake any revision for exams, ideally you will have all of this incorporated
			intor your daily or weekly routine from an early stage as starting on the work early 
			eliminates the last minute rush before hand-in students often find themselves in.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong> Look after yourself </strong>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Aside from full-time studying, it is also important to have time off and make plans
			to go out and relax for periods of time so as to not become overwhelmed with studies.
		
		<br>

			Taking lunch breaks is also vital, especially on days where you have a full timetable, 
			keeping your energy and in turn attention levels high are necessary to successfully 
			undertake ontine training.
