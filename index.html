                    <h5> An introduction </h5>
		<p>
                    Cyber Security is important for everyone - however teaching such an in-depth and ever changing subject to children and young adults 
		    can be challenging. The aim of this website is to supplement this process by giving up-to-date information on a wide variety
                    of issues relating to Cyber Security and the prevention of security breaches and in turn, malicious attacks.
                    <br> These demographics are amongst the heaviest users of the internet; but also generally have a lower level of understanding of 
		    security risks and common malicious practices<a id="security"></a>. This means that younger people on the internet are massively
                    at risk, and it is important to educate them on how to avoid and prevent instances of security breaches.
                </p>

                <h5>Security Mechanisms</h5>

                <p> The risk of cyber-attacks is at an all-time high, with major attacks taking place every day (<a href="https://cyware.com/cyber-security-news-articles">
		    CyWare </a> is a good news page dedicated to recording cyber-attacks). This is a threat that everyone faces, and many people may
		    have unknowingly lost their data to cyber attack (<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"> Have I Been Pwned?</a> - Useful website 
		    where you can check out if your email has been in a data breach! You may be surprised to see the results...) However, security mechanisms
   		    to combat cyber threats are becoming commonplace in the working world today. While many people still don't have an in-depth 
		    understanding of technology, it is paramount for any business or organisation to understand how to protect itself. Many different 
		    security mechanisms can be utilised, and we will be highlighting and explaining a few of the most common ones on this page.

                            <h4>Access Control</h4>
                            <img src="images/authentication.jpg" alt=" Picture of fingerprint " />
				
				<h5>Authentication</h5> 

                            <p>
                                The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) describes authentication as the process of determining if someone is who they 
				claim to be. For a real-world example, this is akin to checking identification or a signature. A key security measure, 
				authentication can stop intruders from accessing important information under false pretences. A common way of utilising this
				is through Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), which is where you must provide evidence of identification through two methods of verification, 
				normally through either an app (e.g. Google Authenticator), or through a code delivered by text. 
                            </p>
				<h5> Authorisation </h5>
				
				<p> Authorisation is a similar security measure to authentication, with the difference being this can be used to access levels of privilege 
				    for clients or users. For example, administrative staff in a company may be able to write and read data, but clients would not have the 
				    authorisation to write data - only to read it. Again, this helps to stop intruders as well as protects the data. </p>
                        </div>


                        <li class="card">

				    <h4>Securing Devices</h4>
                                <img src="images/password.jpg" alt="iPhone password " />
				    
				    <h5>Passwords</h5> 

                               <p> Being perhaps the most well-known security mechanism, passwords are used by nearly eveyone in their day-to-day lives. 
				   While it is just a method of authentication, a password uses encryption to hide a specific phrase.  It is of the 
				   utmost importance for passwords to be changed routinely, to prevent unwanted access to business systems 
				   and personal data. The ideal password should have a mix of letters in different cases, numbers and symbols 
				   (the NCSC recommends using three random words together) - which would be unlikely to be guessed by a human or by 
				   hacking software. Two well-known softwares are <a href="https://www.aircrack-ng.org/"> Aircrack-ng </a> and 
				   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Ripper"> John the Ripper. </a>
			 	   These two hacking tools are easy to find and install and have a lot of relevant information available online so that 
				   nearly anyone who wants to learn to use them for illicit purposes can. Below is a photo of the most used passwords in 
				   the UK according to the NCSC - as you can see, some of these would be incredibly easy to guess within a few attempts.

                                <h4>Security Software</h4>
                                <img src="images/virus.jpg" alt="" />
				    <h5>Anti-Virus</h5>

                                <p>
                                    Anti-Virus (AV) software is used to stop malware from infecting a computer system. These days, this software is 
				    built into many operating systems and devices - for example, the App Store for an iPhone will automatically check
				    downloaded software before you get the apps, and it works similarly with Android phones too. Even Windows and MacOS
				    have built-in AV software - however it may still be beneficial to download third-party software to be safer (like
				    <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes</a>). 
					
				    However there should never be more than one instance of Anti-Virus software running on a system at any time, due to 
				    them conflicting with one another, using increased system resources, giving false virus alerts and leaving the 
				    system vulnerable.
                                </p>
				    
				    <h5>Security Focused Operating Systems</h5>
				    
				    <p>
					An alternative to using this software is to just use an operating system that has been designed with security in
					mind. Many of these are Linux-based and have been created by prioritising privacy, with some of them making 
					it completely impossible for any malware to find a user's IP address. However, this may not always be necessary. 
					Many countries (including the US, Canada, UK, Germany & Netherlands) have created a certification for operating 
					systems to be trusted called the <a href="https://commoncriteriaportal.org/">Common Criteria</a>. The most used operating systems (including Windows & Mac) are 
					certified as trusted.

                                        A more technical security measure than the aforementioned ones. The Cambridge Dictionary defines this as 
					'The process of changing electronic information or signals into a secret code that people cannot understand or 
					use without special equipment'. A key mechanism for safely transferring data, encryption is widely used in 
					messaging apps, for example, Signal or WhatsApp. 	<a id="privacy"></a>

                                        <p>
                                            The NCSC describes a firewall as a hardware or software which uses a rule set to control network traffic to prevent unauthorised access 
					    to or from a network. Essentially, a firewall acts as a barrier protecting a network from anything suspicious entering.

					    like a firewall, rather than just permitting or blocking network connections, an IDS will signal an alarm. This would then go to notify 
					   someone to investigate and respond to an incident.

              <h5>  Issues around privacy in business information systems. </h5>
	
                <p>   
                Cybercrime is an umbrella term used to refer to the use of computers or information technology being used to 
                commit unlawful acts to disrupt, steal or ransom. 'Cyber-dependant' crimes are crimes that can 
                only be committed through the utilisation of computing technologies that target other computing systems, 
                whereas 'Cyber-enabled' crimes are instances where ‘traditional’ crimes have gained a wider reach or increased 
                scale due to computers making them more effective and far easier to carry out. 
                </p>
			
		<br>
		
                <p>
			
                Cybercrimes can be varying affairs, from some users simply being annoyed by the inconvenience, to 
                businesses experiencing enormous financial loss and, in the most extreme cases, even loss of life. 
			
                </p>
			
		<br>

		<p>
		
		They are targetted, malicious attacks by an individual or organization intending to breach the information system of another 
		system, network or organisation. Cyberattacks are committed typically for financial gain, political activism, or personal reasons.
		There are various methods to launch a cyberattack like malware, ransomware, brute-force attacks, denial of service attacks, etc.
		Cyberattacks are dangerous because they can expose bank information, medical records, or personal information. 
		Many people have had their identities stolen due to cyberattacks on big corporations. 
		Big corporations are not the only victims, many people are exposed to malware attacks just from clicking on the 
		wrong things online. The most common attack against inexperienced people suffering from malware is cyber extortion. 
		Cyber extortion is when hackers hold data, computer systems, or sensitive information hostage until payment is made.
		
		Over recent years, the frequency of cyber-attacks has been increasing steadily, with 2021 being a record year 
                for the number of cyber-attacks reported, and with no signs of slowing down, cyber security is 
                one of – if not the most integral part of business infrastructure. The increase in users of high-powered mobile 
                devices has contributed to the growth of cyber security risk - because of everyday people being more 
                susceptible to malicious behaviour and hackers being able to reproduce attacks previously limited to needing a computer to do so. 
	
		</p>
			
		<br>
			
                <p>
			
                There is a myriad of possible attacks targeting secure data in business, the ones we have mentioned already are: 
			
                </p>
			
		<br>
                
                <h5> Brute force attacks </h5> 
			
		<p>	
		Brute force attacks make up about 5% of recorded cyber-attacks and are performed by utilising a program that is 
                effectively ‘guessing’ the username and password needed to access a system as many times as it takes to guess correctly. 
                Brute force attacks come in many forms – one type is called a ‘dictionary attack’ and guesses based on possible known phrases. 
                Brute force attacks are simple but have a high success rate. To combat brute force attacks, usernames and passwords 
                should be long and complex and not utilise information that is personal to the user or company.
                </p>
			
		<br>
                
		<h5> Malware </h5> 
		    
		<p>
		If left unfound, malware can be catastrophic to the integrity of a businesses intellectual property and public image. 
                Malware comes in many different forms, with some of the more popular being; Ransomware – used to encrypt business data and 
                charge money to return it, and Cryptocurrency ‘Mining’ software – which steals computing power to 
                mine virtual currency. However the most common by far is a computer virus, used to delete, alter and encrypt business’ 
                files and data, a virus spreads by infecting files and then making copies of itself on systems to spread itself 
                across a network with the ultimate intention to disrupt and disable. They can be first encountered on a business system 
                by employees using compromised flash storage or opening emails that have originated from outside of the secure network infrastructure. 
                To prevent the acquisition and spread of malicious files, all software used should be kept up-to-date such as your 
                operating systems, browsers and anti-virus. Businesses should also control what USB devices can be connected to computers and 
                firewalls should always be switched on.
                </p>
			
		<br>
			
                <h5> DDoS attacks </h5>  
			
		<p>	
		DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service attacks are attacks that primarily affect businesses as it’s a technique used to overload 
                servers and bring down services and websites, if a DDoS attack has been successful, access to a business website will be 
                impossible for users until the issue is resolved. For an attack to be carried out, 'botnets' (a network of infected computers 
                unbeknownst to the users) or programs are used to flood servers with massive traffic so they are unable to cope and will 
                crash under the load, bringing down the website. These attacks are effective and are often used to mask another concurrent 
                and more serious attack. To mitigate DDoS attacks the main method is to have a large enough bandwidth and server capacity 
                so an attack is absorbed and cannot provide enough requests to bring down your website, but you can also employ a WAF or 
                Web Application Firewall that guards you against commonly found web exploits. 
                </p>
			
		<br>
			
                <p>
               
		Cyber attacks come in multiple forms but these three are some of the more commonly found for businesses and should always be 
                a consideration for every business development as the impact of any attack can be incredibly costly to rectify, not just on 
                a financial level but on a reputational one as well. Companies worldwide suffer data breaches regularly, 
                with Comcast, Facebook and LinkedIN suffering the largerst breaches of 2021, along with many other organisations, 
		proving clearly why cyber security is such an important aspect of business planning and development.
               
		</p>
			
		<br>
			
			<h5> Real world examples </h5>
				
		<p>	
			
		In May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline company was hit by a ransomware attack. Colonial Pipeline transports 45%-50% of the fuel 
		on the eastern coast of the United States. Hackers gained access into the company’s networks through a virtual private network (VPN) account, 
		which allowed employees to work from home. The account was inactive, but the username and password had been sold through the dark web. 
		The hackers were affiliated with a Russian cybercrime group known as DarkSide. The hackers were paid 4.4 million USD after a five-day 
		shut down of the pipeline.
		
		</p>
			
		<p>
			
		In 2016, Russian computer hackers infiltrated the Democratic National Committee computer network. Two separate espionage agents 
		infiltrated the systems at different times and different methods. The first agent implanted a backdoor using a hidden PowerShell 
		script and launched malicious code at various times. The second agent employed malware, which transmitted files, allowed screenshots, 
		log keystrokes, and gather any data needed by the hacker. The second agent then used X-Tunnel malware to exfiltrate stolen data from the 
		compromised computers within the DNC.
			
		</p>
			
		<p>

	 	In February 2015, a ransomware ‘Trojan Horse’ was released to attack gamers around Europe. The ransomware targetted
		save data, player profiles, custom maps, <a id="mitigations"></a>and game mods stored on the victim’s hard drive. It affected predominantly 40 games, including 
		the Call of Duty series, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, World of Tanks, Starcraft, and Dragon Age. The victim would then be prompted 
		to pay a ransom of $500 worth of Bitcoin in order to obtain the decryption key.
			
		</p>
			
                    <h5> Mitigation</h5>
			
		<p>
                    An effective and near worry-free method of mitigation is the act of Security as a service. Security as a service (SECaas) is the 
		    term used when an outside provider deals with the security of an organisation's computing infrastructure. This generally involves
                    the security company monitoring the system and responding to or preventing any threats that are likely to occur as well as strategies 
		    for things like data loss prevention. Utilizing a SECaas provider can save an organisation time and resources
                    that could be better spent elsewhere in the business. It also negates the need to pay for staff to be routinely trained. 
		    An example of one of the top SECaas companies is McAfee which has been around for a long time and is one of the most trusted names 
		    in the industry.
		</p>	
			
                </header>

                <br>

                
                    <h5> Prevention</h5>
		<p>
                    Effective techniques for prevention include: developing effective security policies to make sure everyone knows the rules to adhere 
		    to, making sure that all staff or appropriate users are given relevant security awareness training which will instill the
                    policies and procedures of the organisation into the minds of the staff and ensure that they are followed and implemented at all 
		    times. It is very important if an organisation is responsible for its own security that it has reliable
                    security software installed and monitored. The most effective security software will be simple to use and include a straightforward
		    user interface that is not confusing and easy to get to grips with. It will allow the organisation
                    to monitor and deploy various security functions to the users and systems within the organizations infrastructure. 
		    It should also be intuitive enough that staff using it can accomplish their objectives efficiently and don't have to
                    spend too much time that could be used elsewhere, figuring out how to work the software.
                </p>

               
                    <h5> Detection</h5>

		<p>
		    
                    An Anti-virus that includes all the necessary protections for the specific needs of the organization, such as anti-spyware and 
	            malware, is one of the most important tools to detect any potential threats that an organization can encounter. Restricting
                    access to relevant users only by implementing passwords and log-in systems for individuals with varying degrees of permission to 
	            interact with data. Using an access control matrix to assess the eligibility of users is a very effective
                    method of monitoring who can have access to certain data and information, making it easier to deduce who could have sabotaged 
	            or misused their position, whether intentionally or not. If it was an accidental event then perhaps more
                    training can be provided and if it was a deliberate act then disciplinary action will be easier to take.

                    <h5> Remediation </h5>

		<p>
		    
                    The act of reacting to the breach once found and limiting the amount of damage that it can do to the organisation. The cause then 
	            needs to be identified and prevented next time. A proper plan should be in place that deals with the most serious threats
                    and specifies appropriate countermeasures. Some important elements of remediation are: creating an up to date risk assessment, 
	            employing a suitable monitoring process to keep an eye on the comings and goings of data, making sure that staff
                    have relevant training and practice to keep themselves from panicking if malicious events occur, consider security as a service to 
	            outsource the protection and free up employees time to focus on other things, potentially increasing production output.

                    <h5> More advice</h5>

                <p>
		    
                    Many issues can be of concern to a business regarding privacy and it is important to have a good understanding of 
	            what some of the main issues can be as well as ways to mitigate the chances of vulnerabilities, exploits and malicious attacks.
                    If confidential information is kept about individuals by a business, it is essential that the data is kept secure and that access 
	            to the information is moderated appropriately according to the Data Protection Act 2018. At a basic level,
                    this can be in the form of passwords and login details. Permission can also be granted to relevant users based on an Access Control
	            matrix. This is a method of correctly distributing necessary permissions that makes it easier to denote
                    who is granted which level of access to data. There are many reasons that data/info might be attempted to be accessed or collected, 
	            it could be for financial gain if the individual involved wanted to sell information or upload malicious
                    software onto a system. The company's regulations for security must be followed by all employees as it is 
	            the responsibility of everyone working there once properly trained and instructed to help prevent breaches.
