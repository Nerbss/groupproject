        </p>

        <p>

		Cyber Security is important for everyone - however teaching such an in-depth and ever changing subject to 
		children and young adults can be challenging. The aim of this website is to supplement this process by giving up-to-date information on a wide variety
                of issues relating to Cyber Security and the prevention of security breaches and in turn, malicious attacks.
        <br>    
		These demographics are amongst the heaviest users of the internet; but also generally have a lower level 
		of understanding of security risks and common malicious practices. This means that younger people on the internet are massively
                at risk, and it is important to educate them on how to avoid and prevent instances of security breaches.

        </p>
		    
                <h5>Security Mechanisms</h5>
                <a id="security"></a>
		    
		    <p> Many security mechanisms to combat cyber threats are commonplace in the working world today. The threat of cyber attacks is at an all-time high and it is paramount for a business or organisation to understand how to combat this threat. There are many security mechanisms that can be utilised, and on this site we will be highlighting a few of them. </p>

                            <h4>Authentication</h4>
                            <img src="http://jch74.brighton.domains/GP/images/laptop.jpg" alt=" ALTERNATE TEXT HERE" />
				<p>The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) describes authentication is the process of determining if someone is who they claim to be. This is akin to checking identification or a signature in a real-world example. A key security measure, this can stop any intruders falsely accessing any information. <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"> Have I Been Pwned?</a> - Useful website where you can check out if your email has been in a data breach!  </p>

                                <h4>Authorisation</h4>
                                <img src="http://jch74.brighton.domains/GP/images/cleardesk.jpg" alt="" />
                                <p>Authorisation is a similar security measure to authentication, with the difference being this can be used to access levels of privilege for clients or users. For example, admin staff in a company may be able to write and read data, but clients would not have authorisation to write data, only read it. Again, this helps to stop intruders as well protects the data.  </p>

                                    <p> A more technical security measure than the aforementioned ones. The Cambridge Dictionary defines this as ‘The process of changing electronic information or signals into a secret code that people cannot understand or use without special equipment.’ A key mechanism for safely transferring data, encryption is widely used in messaging apps, for example, Signal or WhatsApp. </p>

                                        <p> The NCSC describes a firewall as a hardware or software which uses a rule set to control network traffic to prevent unauthorised access to or from a network. Lorem ipsum …. </p>

                                        <p>An Intrusion Detection System, or more commonly an IDS, is a monitoring device that detects threats and generates alerts. While is this similar to a firewall, rather than just permitting or blocking network connections, an IDS will signal an alarm. This can then go on to notify someone to investigate a respond to an incident. </p>

		<p>
                    <h5> Prevention</h5>
                </p> 
		
		<p>
			Effective techniques for prevention include: developing effective security policies to make sure everyone knows the rules to adhere to,
			making sure that all staff or appropriate users are given relevant security awareness training.
			Making sure reliable security software is installed and monitored. 
		      
		</p>
	    	
	    
		<p>
                    <h5> Detection</h5>
                </p> 
		
		<p>
			An Anti-virus that includes all the necessary protections for the specific needs of the organization,
			restricting access to relevant users only by implementing passwords and log in systems for individuals with varying degrees of permission to interact with data,
			using an access control matrix to asses the eligibility of users.  and permissions.
		     
		</p>
                <p>
                    <h5> Remediation  </h5>
                </p> 
		
		<p>
			The act of reacting to the breach once found and limiting the amount of damage that it can do to the organization. The cause then needs to be identified and prevented next time.
			A proper plan should be in place that deals with the most serious threats and specifies appropriate countermeasures. Some important elements of remediation are: creating an up to date risk assessment,
			employing a suitable monitoring process to keep an eye on comings and goings of data, making sure that staff have relevant training and practice to keep themselves from panicking if malicious events occur, 
			consider security as a service to outsource the protection and free up employees time to focus on other things potentially increasing productivity output.

                <p>
                    <h5> More advice</h5>
                </p> 
		
		<p>
		    There are many issues that can be of concern to a business regarding privacy and it is important to have a good understanding of what some of the main issues 
		    can be as well as ways to mitigate the chances of vulnerabilities, exploits and malicious attacks. If confidential information is kept about individuals by a business,
		    it is essential that the data is kept secure and that access to the information is moderated appropriately according to the Data Protection Act 2018. At a basic level 
		    this can be in the form of passwords and log in details. Permission can also be granted to relevant users based on an Access Control matrix. This is a method of correctly 
		    distributing necessary permissions that makes it easier to denote who is granted which level of access to data. There are many reasons that data/info might be attempted to
		    be accessed or collected, it could be for financial gain if the individual involved wanted to sell information or upload malicious software onto a system. It is very important
		    that the companies regulations for security are followed by all employees as it is the responsibility of everyone working there once properly trained and instructed to help prevent breaches.

		      This image shows the most commonly used passwords and the amount of times they were found to have been used. 
		      It is of the utmost importance for passwords to be changed routinely in order to prevent unwanted and illicit 
		      access to business systems and data. 
	      
	      
		      

		
		
		      Passwords should have a mix of lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers and punctuation so they are unlikely 
		      to be guessed and they cannot easily be brute forced by software such as <a href="https://www.aircrack-ng.org/"> Aircrack-ng </a>
		      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Ripper"> John the Ripper. </a> These tools are simple to access, easy 
		      to install and have a huge amount of material readily available online so that anyone who wants to learn to use these tools for 
		      illicit purposes, can do so, making passwords the first and very often the last line of defence between you and an attacker.
